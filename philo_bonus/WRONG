- no leaks in children processes in routine
'---> but leaks in children processes in meals_routine because of a thread (check_death possible)

- after a bug correction, now the main in meals_routine waits a philo to die even if they've all eaten before.
==> FIXED bc usleep was too long in exit_clean (routine.c)

- data race possible with frane->dead but not with frame->check_meals : why ?

- should we use only one semaphore check like frame->lock in mandatory part ?

***** 			------------- 			*****

TO DO :
- try w/o frame->dead = 1 what changes
